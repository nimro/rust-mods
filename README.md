# murder-chickens
This mod gives all chickens the health and damage of bears, and maximises their aggression. Use with caution!

It's highly recommended to set the server variable "chickens.population" to 1. This makes it more likely to encounter a single chicken at a time, which is the most lethal. Due to the way the AI works groups of chickens tend to attack each other rather than the player, even though they are configured not to!
